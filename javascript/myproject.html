 <h1 class="do"> Captain Velupillai Parbhakaran</h1>

 <p class="one">Velupillai Prabhakaran was born on November 26, 1954, in the coastal town of Velvettithurai in northern Sri Lanka. He grew up witnessing the discrimination and marginalization faced by the Tamil people
 under the Sinhala-majority Sri Lankan government. In response to this oppression, Prabhakaran founded the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 1976, at the age of 22, with the goal of creating an independent
 Tamil homeland called Tamil Eelam.</p>
<p class="one">Over time, the LTTE evolved from a small rebel group into one of the most powerful and organized militant 
 organizations in the world, complete with its own army, navy (Sea Tigers), and even a small air force (Air Tigers).
Prabhakaran was known for his strict discipline, strategic brilliance, and his unwavering commitment to Tamil nationalism. Under his leadership, the LTTE engaged in a violent and prolonged civil war with the Sri Lankan government that lasted over 25 years, from 1983 to 2009. The group carried out many high-profile attacks, including the assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, which led to international condemnation. Despite the controversy, many Tamils saw
 Prabhakaran as a fearless leader who gave voice to their struggles and sacrificed his life for their rights and dignity.</p>

 <p id="more">Prabhakaran founded the LTTE in 1976, initially operating as a small guerrilla group in the Tamil-majority northern and eastern regions of Sri Lanka. His goal was to create an independent Tamil Eelam (Tamil state) 
    to address the grievances of the Tamil minority, who faced political and social discrimination from the Sri Lankan government.
The LTTE carried out numerous attacks against the Sri Lankan military, including assassinations, bombings, and ambushes. It also gained control of key regions in the north, including the Jaffna Peninsula, becoming the de facto government in areas under its control.
The Sri Lankan government responded with large-scale military operations, and the LTTE adopted guerrilla tactics, including ambushing army convoys and using landmines and explosives.
One of the most significant moments during this period was the 1987 intervention by India. The Indian government, under Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, sent the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to Sri Lanka to try to mediate peace between the government and 
the LTTE. However, the LTTE viewed the IPKF as an enemy, and fierce fighting broke out, resulting in many casualties on both sides.</p>
